# Real Data Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of all the changes made to implement real-time data fetching from bookmakers in the Sport Arbitrage application.

## Overview of Changes

We've transformed the application from using mock data to fetching real-time odds data from bookmakers through web scraping. This implementation ensures that the application works with actual market data, allowing for genuine arbitrage opportunity detection.

## Key Components Added

1. **Proxy Server (server.js)**
   - Node.js Express server for web scraping
   - Playwright-based scraping engine
   - Caching system to reduce load on bookmaker websites
   - Scheduled data updates via cron jobs
   - API endpoints for accessing odds data

2. **API Integration (src/lib/api.ts)**
   - Updated to fetch data from the proxy server
   - Removed mock data generation
   - Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Data quality validation

3. **Mock Data Removal (src/utils/mockData.ts)**
   - Replaced mock data generation with real data integration
   - Maintained backward compatibility for testing

4. **Helper Scripts**
   - `start.sh`: Unified script to start both frontend and server
   - `test-server.js`: Script to test the proxy server
   - `update-selectors.js`: Tool to update web scraping selectors when bookmaker websites change

5. **Documentation**
   - `README-REAL-DATA.md`: Detailed documentation on the real data implementation
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Guide for deploying to production environments
   - Updated main README.md with real data information

## Implementation Details

### Proxy Server Architecture

The proxy server uses Playwright to scrape odds data from bookmaker websites. It implements several features to ensure reliable data access:

- **Web Scraping**: Uses headless Chrome to extract odds data
- **Caching**: File-based caching to reduce the number of scraping operations
- **User Agent Rotation**: Rotates user agents to avoid detection
- **Scheduled Updates**: Automatically refreshes data every hour
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed logging

### API Endpoints

The proxy server exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/odds/1xbet`: Get odds from 1xBet
- `GET /api/odds/sportybet`: Get odds from SportyBet
- `GET /api/odds/all`: Get combined odds from all bookmakers
- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint

### Frontend Integration

The frontend application connects to the proxy server to fetch odds data:

- Updated `src/lib/api.ts` to use the proxy server
- Removed mock data generation in favor of real data
- Enhanced error handling and data validation
- Maintained the same data structure for compatibility with existing components

## Currently Supported Bookmakers

- **1xBet**: Fully implemented with web scraping
- **SportyBet**: Fully implemented with web scraping
- Other bookmakers: Framework in place for easy addition

## How to Use

### Starting the Application

```bash
# Start both proxy server and frontend
./start.sh

# Or run them separately
npm run server    # Start the proxy server
npm run dev       # Start the frontend
```

### Testing the Server

```bash
npm run test:server
```

### Updating Selectors

If bookmaker websites change their structure, use the selector update tool:

```bash
npm run update-selectors
```

## Production Deployment

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions on deploying to production environments.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Bookmakers**: Add support for more bookmakers
2. **Database Integration**: Store historical odds data
3. **Advanced Caching**: Implement Redis or similar for more efficient caching
4. **IP Rotation**: Add IP rotation to avoid being blocked
5. **Machine Learning**: Implement ML for predicting odds movements

## Troubleshooting

1. **No Data**: Check if the proxy server is running and accessible
2. **Scraping Failures**: Bookmaker websites may have changed their structure
3. **Performance Issues**: Check server resources and consider scaling

## Conclusion

The real data implementation transforms the Sport Arbitrage application from a demo to a fully functional tool that can identify actual arbitrage opportunities in the market. The architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, and maintainable, with clear documentation and helper tools to assist with ongoing development and maintenance.
