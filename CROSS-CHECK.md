# Sport Arbitrage Implementation Cross-Check

This document provides a comprehensive checklist and verification steps to ensure the real data implementation works perfectly with 100% accuracy.

## Prerequisites Check

Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [ ] Node.js (v16 or higher)
- [ ] npm (v7 or higher)
- [ ] Chrome or Chromium browser (for Playwright)

### Installation Instructions

1. **Install Node.js and npm**:
   - macOS: `brew install node` (using Homebrew) or download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Windows: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Linux: `sudo apt install nodejs npm` (Ubuntu/Debian) or equivalent for your distribution

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   node -v  # Should show v16.x.x or higher
   npm -v   # Should show v7.x.x or higher
   ```

3. **Install Project Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Install Playwright Browser**:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

## Code Quality Check

### Server.js

- [ ] Express server setup is correct
- [ ] CORS middleware is properly configured
- [ ] Cache directory creation logic works
- [ ] Web scraping functions are properly implemented for each bookmaker
- [ ] API endpoints are correctly defined
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Caching mechanism works as expected
- [ ] Scheduled updates via cron are properly configured

### API Integration (src/lib/api.ts)

- [ ] Proxy server URL is correctly defined
- [ ] Functions to fetch data from each bookmaker are implemented
- [ ] Error handling and retries are properly implemented
- [ ] Data validation is thorough
- [ ] Data normalization functions work correctly

### Mock Data Removal (src/utils/mockData.ts)

- [ ] Mock data generation is removed
- [ ] Empty array is exported as fallback
- [ ] Import for fetchAllOdds is correct

## Functional Testing

### Server Tests

1. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

2. **Test Endpoints**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:server
   ```

3. **Manual API Testing**:
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:3001/health`
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:3001/api/odds/1xbet`
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:3001/api/odds/sportybet`
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:3001/api/odds/all`

### Frontend Tests

1. **Start the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Verify Data Flow**:
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:8080`
   - Check browser console for API requests
   - Verify odds data is displayed correctly
   - Test filtering and sorting functionality
   - Verify arbitrage calculations are correct

## Data Accuracy Check

### 1xBet Data

- [ ] Match data is correctly extracted
- [ ] Team names are accurate
- [ ] Odds values are correct and up-to-date
- [ ] League information is accurate
- [ ] Match times are correctly formatted

### SportyBet Data

- [ ] Match data is correctly extracted
- [ ] Team names are accurate
- [ ] Odds values are correct and up-to-date
- [ ] League information is accurate
- [ ] Match times are correctly formatted

### Combined Data

- [ ] Data from both bookmakers is properly combined
- [ ] No duplicate matches
- [ ] Consistent data format across bookmakers
- [ ] Arbitrage opportunities are correctly identified

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Node.js Not Found

If you see `command not found: node`, you need to install Node.js:

```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install node

# Or download from nodejs.org
```

### Playwright Browser Installation Failed

If Playwright browser installation fails:

```bash
# Try installing with sudo
sudo npx playwright install chromium

# Or install manually and set the path
export PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/path/to/browsers
npx playwright install chromium
```

### CORS Issues

If you see CORS errors in the console:

1. Check that the server is running
2. Verify CORS configuration in server.js
3. Ensure the VITE_PROXY_SERVER environment variable is set correctly

### No Data Received

If no data is being received:

1. Check that the proxy server is running
2. Verify network connectivity
3. Check if bookmaker websites have changed their structure
4. Run the selector update tool: `npm run update-selectors`

### Scraping Failures

If scraping is failing:

1. Check if bookmaker websites have changed their structure
2. Update selectors using `npm run update-selectors`
3. Check if your IP is being blocked (consider using a VPN)
4. Try increasing timeouts in the server.js file

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Frontend connects to the server successfully
- [ ] Data is fetched from both bookmakers
- [ ] Data is accurately parsed and normalized
- [ ] Arbitrage opportunities are correctly calculated
- [ ] UI displays the data correctly
- [ ] Filtering and sorting work as expected
- [ ] No console errors during normal operation
- [ ] Cache system is working (check cache directory)
- [ ] Scheduled updates are running

## Production Readiness

- [ ] Environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Logging is implemented
- [ ] Performance is optimized
- [ ] Security considerations are addressed
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

## Final Verification

After completing all checks, run the full application:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Verify that:
1. Both server and frontend start successfully
2. Real-time data is fetched and displayed
3. Arbitrage opportunities are correctly identified
4. All features work as expected

If all checks pass, the implementation is working perfectly with 100% accuracy.
